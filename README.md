## Team vibe / organisation

- Check in (how are you? How do you feel about working on this larger project?)
Good!

- Wellbeing for each person (when I’m stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc) for each person
Mel - sleep / breaks / coffee
Ashley - sleep / coffee
Eben - sleep / coffee
Mimi - music / alone
Serafin - space

- Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep outside of bootcamp, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)
We may work in the evenings (we'll see how we go). We will use Slack to communicate with each other around this. However, we've decided that we will come into Campus on Saturday from 10 until 4.30/5pm.

We will get in touch with the Human Skills facilitators if there is conflict in terms of team morale. If there is a conflict regarding the tech side, we will get in touch with a facilitator - this will be done within a reasonable timeframe so we keep the momentum and productivity going.

- How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?
When it comes to decisions, we will come together in a stand up. When it comes to conflict, see above, however, we will apply what we have learnt in the Human Skills sessions, i.e. non-violent communication / couragous conversations model.

- How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically?
See above!

- How will you make sure everyone feels included?
Everyone havin the responsibility of being vibe checker and having their ideas heard.

- How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations
Depends on the role of the person and the feature that's being worked on.

- How will you work (what roles and what agile rituals will you use etc)
Eben - Scrum Lead
Ashley - PO
Serfain - Backend Lead
Mimi - Frontend Lead
Mel - Git Keeper

- How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
We will eat together and play games

## Project planning

- What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it? When do you want to reach MVP by?
- What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? If you’re using our stack, will you use Redux?
- GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
- Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas? Will you swap roles at some point?
- What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen? When during the day will you do the hard tech? Will you go outside _as a team_?
- How will you reflect and improve over the week?
